        <h2>What is marketing?</h2>
        <p>
          As a marketing member of AFT, I worked close with all the teams to
          create a strategy for their event. We drafted various strategies and
          executed them.
        </p>
        <h2>Skills learned</h2>
        <p>
          At AFT, I learned a variety of skills, such as planning and
          organisation. Moreover, I also learned to work with the Adobe Suite,
          programs such as Illustrator and PhotoShop have become my second
          nature.
